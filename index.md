## About Me

I'm Mario Alvarado and I'm currently a Master's Student in Computer Science. I have a B.S. in Chemistry and was an inorganic Chemist for the government before I made the switch to Computer Science. Before that, I was in a Biochemistry research lab at my alma mater. I helped developed a method to determine the best matrix for MALDI to use on a brain section of the NPC2 mouse for the spatial mapping of lipids produced from the brain. I also started a neural cell line of these NPC2 mice for neural protein production. I eventually hope to combine my fields in chemistry, biochemistry, and computer science together. I now study at DePaul University and I am planning to graduate in the fall of 2022.

## About My Project
![]({{page.image|relative_url}})

My Project is mainly focusing on image processing. In collaboration with a group from Rush University, we plan to automate the labeling process of key features in brain scans. There are thousands of brain scans, and the group must manually find and label them. The group will provide us with a sample data set of the brain scans (both labeled and unlabeled) and will use the dataset as the foundation for the automated process.
